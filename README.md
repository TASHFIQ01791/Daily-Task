Here, I want to document my journey through the MERN stack. Starting from HTML5, my goal is to progress all the way to mastering Next.js. I'll be sharing daily notes of my practice, hoping that both I and anyone reading this can find motivation and inspiration along the way.

Thank you for joining me on this learning journey!
